# My Journey into Artificial Intelligence

Hello everybody 
This repository documents my **personal roadmap** to master **AI & Machine Learning** and eventually become **one of the greatest innovators in the field**.  
I’ll keep updating this file regularly as I progress through new courses, projects, and discoveries.

## Phase 1: Building Strong Foundations

Before diving deep into the world of AI, I wanted to make sure my **Computer Science** and **Mathematics** fundamentals were solid — the true backbone behind every AI system.

### Computer Science Fundamentals

Before teaching machines to think, I must first master how thinking is translated into code.

## Videos that help me very much in the begginng

These videos were the spark that turned curiosity into obsession — and obsession into purpose

## Phase 2: Mathematical Foundation for AI

Mathematics is the language of the universe — and AI speaks it fluently.  
This phase is all about mastering calculus, linear algebra, and the mathematical intuition behind deep learning.

### Core Math Foundations

| Probability | Khan Academy | ⏳ 0 / 41 | [Khan Academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC58778F28211FA19) |


Math isn’t a wall — it’s a language. I realized that Linear Algebra isn’t about matrices, it’s about transformations. Calculus is about change, and probability is about belief.
