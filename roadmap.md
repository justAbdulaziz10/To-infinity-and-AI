# My Journey into Artificial Intelligence

Hello everybody 
This repository documents my **personal roadmap** to master **AI & Machine Learning** and eventually become **one of the greatest innovators in the field**.  
I’ll keep updating this file regularly as I progress through new courses, projects, and discoveries.
