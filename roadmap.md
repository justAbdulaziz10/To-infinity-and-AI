# My Journey into Artificial Intelligence

Hello everybody 👋  
This repository documents my **personal roadmap** to master **AI & Machine Learning** and eventually become **one of the greatest innovators in the field**.  
I’ll keep updating this file regularly as I progress through new courses, projects, and discoveries.

## Phase 1: Building Strong Foundations

Before diving deep into the world of AI, I wanted to make sure my **Computer Science** and **Mathematics** fundamentals were solid — the true backbone behind every AI system.

### 🧠 Computer Science Fundamentals

## Phase 2: Mathematical Foundation for AI

Mathematics is the language of the universe — and AI speaks it fluently.  
This phase is all about mastering calculus, linear algebra, and the mathematical intuition behind deep learning.

## Vision

> *“AI isn’t just technology — it’s the next form of human intelligence.”*  
> My dream is to become one of the greatest minds in AI, building systems that make life more human, not less.  
> This journey is just the beginning — and the best part is still ahead.

Stay tuned — I’ll keep updating this roadmap with every course completed, every project launched, and every milestone achieved.
